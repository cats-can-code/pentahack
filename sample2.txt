Grammar is a very old field of study. Did you know that the 
sentence was first divided into subject and verb by Plato, 
the famed philosopher from ancient Greece? That was 
about 2,400 years ago! Ever since then, students all over 
the world have found it worthwhile to study the structure 
of words and sentences. Why? Because skill in speaking 
and writing is the hallmark of all educated people.
Lesson by lesson, this book provides basic instruction 
in the eight parts of speech—nouns, pronouns, verbs, 
adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and 
interjections—as well as the standard patterns of English 
sentences.
All students of English, be they native speakers or those 
who are studying English as a second language, will 
profit from the fundamental introduction and review of 
grammar provided by SADDLEBACK’S BASIC ENGLISH 
GRAMMAR 1 and 2. Helpful marginal notes throughout 
the books have been provided to reinforce existing skills 
and call attention to common problem areas.
We wish you every success in your pursuit of English 
proficiency.1What is Grammar? 5

Here’s an old children’s rhyme about the eight parts of 
speech of English grammar. It gives you an idea of what 
grammar is about. Read and remember it. 
Every name is called a noun ,
As field and fountain , street  and town .
In place of noun the pronoun  stands,
As he and she can clap their hands.
The adjective  describes a thing, 
As magic  wand or bridal  ring.
Most verbs  mean action, something done,
To read  and write , to jump  and run.
How things are done the adverbs  tell,
As quickly , slowly , badly , well.
The preposition  shows relation,
As in the street or at the station.
Conjunctions  join, in many ways,
Sentences, words, or phrase and phrase.
The interjection  cries out, “ Heed!
An exclamation point must 
follow me!”What is Grammar?1

A sports car is faster than  a motorbike.fast

For example, you say:
Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the 
world.
Peter is the tallest boy in his class.darkest
longest longer longdark darker 
thick thicker
thickest
clean cleaner  cleanest
easy easier easiest
fat fatter fattest
flat flatter  flattest
heavy heavier heaviest
hot hotter hottest
narrow narrower  narrowest
noisy noisier noisiest
simple simpler simplest
thin thinner thinnest
wet wetter wettest67GrammarHelp
4	With adjectives that end in - e, add - r to form
 the comparative , and - st to form the superlative . 
 For example:
  Comparative Superlative
  close close r close st
 large large r large st
 safe safer safest
 wide wide r wide st
4	Some adjectives have only one syllable, end with a  
consonant, and have a single vowel before the   
consonant. With these adjectives, double the last letter 
before adding – er to form the comparative , and - est to 
form the superlative . For example:
  Comparative Superlative
 big bigger  biggest
 dim dimmer  dimmest
 mad madder  maddest
 sad sadder  saddest
4	Some adjectives have two syllables and end in - y. With 
these adjectives change the y to i. Then add - er to form 
the comparative , and - est to form the superlative . 
For example:
  Comparative Superlative
 busy busier busiest
 dirty dirtier dirtiest
 happy happ ier happ iest 
 pretty prettier prettiest68
With some adjectives, you use more  to make the 
comparative form, and most to make the superlative 
form.
Adjectives that form their comparative and 
superlative with more  and most  are usually 
adjectives with two or more syllables , or 
sounds. For example:
 ac-tive ex-pen-sive
 beau-ti-ful fa-mous
 charm-ing for-tu-nate

comfortable  more  comfortable  most  comfortable
delicious more  delicious most delicious

adjectives are completely different words.
With these adjectives, you don’t add - er or more

YesNo147Questions
 There are two kinds of questions: yes or no questions  
 and wh- questions.
4	You ask a yes or no question to get yes or no as the 
answer. Use the verbs be, have  or do, or any of the 
helping verbs, to ask yes or no questions.
 Can you swim? Yes. Are they coming? No.
 Is it raining?  No. May I come in? Yes.
4	In questions, the helping or auxiliary verbs come before 
the subject of the sentence. When be and have    
are used as ordinary verbs, they come before the 
subjects, too.
GrammarHelpHere are some different ways of asking the 
same question:
 Has he a sister called Jane?
 Does he have a sister called Jane?
 Has he got a sister called Jane?  Statement  Question

 You may use my computer.  May  I use your computer?

4	If the wh- question word is the subject of the question,  
 it comes before the verb. For example:Wh- questions usually include the verbs be, have ,   
do, or any of the helping verbs.
4	To ask for facts, use the question words what , which ,  
 who , whom , how , when , where . The helping verbs   
 in wh- questions usually come before the subject. So  
 does the verb be when it is used as an ordinary verb.

 For example: 
  I’ll buy some bread at the baker’s .
  I was reading a book at the dentist’s .
  It’s time you went to the barber’s . 
4	You can also refer to your friends’ homes  
 in the same way:

  I stayed the night at Susan’s .  
4 How do you make a possessive form of two people  
 joined by and, such as Peter and John, or Mary and  
  Anne? Put ’ s only after the second name . 
 For example: 
  Barbara and David’s  house  
  Jill and Andy’s party

 used without a following noun.  For example:
  Which desk is Susan’s ? 
  George’s  is in the back row. 
  This room is my brother’s . 
156The apostrophe  can also be used to show that one or 
more letters in a contraction have been left out.
