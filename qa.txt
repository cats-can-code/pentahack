Q: What are the five functions of a digital computer?
A: The five functions of a digital computer are taking data as input, storing data, processing data, generating output, and controlling all these steps.

Q: What is an input device?
A: An input device is a peripheral or hardware equipment used to provide data and control signals to a computer system, such as a keyboard or mouse.

Q: What is RAM?
A: RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a computer memory scheme responsible for storing data temporarily that can be accessed by the processor promptly.

Q: What is the difference between ROM and RAM?
A: ROM is a permanent storage device that does not allow modifications, while RAM is volatile in nature and can be erased once the supply to the storage device is turned off.

Q: What is an output device?
A: An output device is a piece of computer hardware used to communicate the results of data processing carried out by a computer, such as a printer or monitor.

Q: What is system software?
A: System software is responsible for controlling and managing the individual hardware components of a computer system, such as an operating system and fundamental utilities.

Q: What is application software?
A: Application software is computer software designed to help the user perform specific tasks, such as word processing or database management.

Q: What is the CPU responsible for?
A: The CPU is responsible for all the functions and processes of a computer, and it is comprised of an Arithmetic Logic Unit, a Control Unit, and Registers.

Q: What is a hard disk?
A: A hard disk is a device that stores and provides relatively quick access to large amounts of data on an electromagnetically charged surface, which is part of a unit called a disk drive or hard drive.

Q: What is the difference between primary and secondary memory?
A: Primary memory, such as RAM, is responsible for storing data temporarily and accessing it promptly, while secondary memory, such as a hard drive, stores data and programs permanently and retains them even when the power is turned off.
Q: What is the basic unit used in computer data storage?
A: The basic unit used in computer data storage is called a bit.

Q: What is the system software and why is it necessary for application software?
A: System software is a type of computer software that is designed to operate and control computer hardware. Application software cannot run without the presence of the system software.

Q: How is computer speed measured?
A: The speed of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) is measured by Hertz (Hz), which represent a CPU cycle.

Q: What are Trojans and how do they work?
A: Trojans are computer programs that claim to do one thing but instead do damage when you run them. They have no way to replicate automatically.

Q: What is a virus?
A: A virus is a small piece of software that piggybacks on real programs and has the chance to reproduce or wreak havoc.

Q: What is the difference between data and information?
A: Data is unstructured facts and figures while information has been contextualized, categorized, calculated, and condensed.

Q: What is the difference between a personal computer and a workstation?
A: A personal computer is a small, single-user computer based on a microprocessor used for everyday tasks while a workstation is a powerful, single-user computer used for more intensive tasks.

Q: What are the characteristics of a computer?
A: The characteristics of a computer are speed, accuracy, diligence, storage capability, and versatility.

Q: What is a netbook?
A: A netbook is a type of laptop that is designed to be more portable and cheaper than laptops or desktops.

Q: How can viruses be avoided?
A: Viruses can be avoided by installing anti-virus software, using a virus scan before opening new programs or files, being cautious when accepting files or clicking links online, and regularly backing up important data.
